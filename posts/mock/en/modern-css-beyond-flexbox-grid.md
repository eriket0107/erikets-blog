# Modern CSS: Beyond Flexbox and Grid

CSS has evolved dramatically over the past few years. While Flexbox and Grid have revolutionized layout, a new wave of features is giving developers even more power and control. In this article, we'll explore the future of CSS. We'll look at container queries, which allow components to adapt to their container's size, not just the viewport's. We will also dive into the :has() selector, often called the 'parent selector,' which opens up new possibilities for styling based on an element's children. Finally, we'll experiment with scroll-driven animations, a new way to create engaging user experiences tied to scroll position.
