# Type-Safe APIs with tRPC

tRPC allows you to build fully typesafe APIs with ease. By inferring the router definition on the client, you get autocompletion and type checking for your API calls, catching errors at build time instead of runtime. It's a game-changer for full-stack TypeScript developers.
