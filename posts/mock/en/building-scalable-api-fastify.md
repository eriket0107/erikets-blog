# Building a Scalable API with Node.js and Fastify

When it comes to building APIs with Node.js, Express has long been the go-to choice. However, a new generation of frameworks is pushing the boundaries of performance. Enter Fastify. Designed from the ground up to be highly performant, Fastify achieves this through a powerful hook system and a schema-based approach to JSON parsing and serialization. This post will guide you through the process of setting up a new project, defining routes, validating input, and connecting to a database. We will build a complete RESTful API that is not only fast but also well-structured and easy to scale.
