# Mastering Advanced TypeScript

Welcome to our deep dive into advanced TypeScript! In this post, we will explore some of the most powerful features that TypeScript has to offer. We'll start with conditional types, which allow you to create types that change based on the properties of other types. Then, we'll move on to mapped types, a feature that lets you transform existing types into new ones. Finally, we'll cover decorators, an experimental feature that provides a way to add annotations and meta-programming syntax for classes and class members. By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of how to leverage these features to write more robust, flexible, and maintainable code.
