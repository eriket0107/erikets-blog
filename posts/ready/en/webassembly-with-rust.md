# Introduction to WebAssembly with Rust

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that allows you to run code written in languages like C++, C#, and Rust on the web at near-native speed. This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Rust environment and compiling your first Rust program into a Wasm module that can be called from JavaScript.
